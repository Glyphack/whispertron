Do not waste tokens. Prefer non verbose commands and only take what you need.
I need to create the files in Xcode. When you want a new file ask me to create it.

# Commands

Build: `./build.sh` (downloads dependencies and builds with xcodebuild)

Test: No automated tests

Lint: No linter configured

# Architecture

macOS dictation app using Whisper.cpp via xcframework. HotKey triggers recording, transcribes audio, injects text via CGEvent. Uses AVAudioEngine for recording.

Key components:

- AppDelegate.swift: Main app logic, hotkey handling, text injection
- Recorder.swift: Audio recording and transcription
- LibWhisper.swift: Whisper.cpp bindings
- ViewController.swift: UI (if any)

# Code Style

Swift with modern concurrency (async/await). Uses os.Logger for logging. Private vars/properties. Closures for handlers. No explicit types unless needed. Error handling with do/catch. No trailing semicolons. 2-space indentation.
